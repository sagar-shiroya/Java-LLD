# Prototype Design Pattern

imagine you love drawing and you have a special drawing of a cute monster. Now, your friend also wants a drawing of a monster, but with some changes â€“ maybe a different color or a new shape for the monster's eyes.

Instead of drawing the whole monster again, you can use the prototype design pattern. It's like making a photocopy of your original drawing and then changing the parts you want. So, you keep the main idea (the prototype), and easily create new drawings with slight variations.

In simpler terms, the prototype design pattern helps you make copies of things you already have, saving time and effort when you need something similar but slightly different. It's like having a template for creating things!

## Implementation
Let's imagine you have a game where players can create their own characters, and each character has a unique set of features, like hairstyle, clothing, and accessories. Now, players want to create similar characters but with small variations without starting from scratch every time.
