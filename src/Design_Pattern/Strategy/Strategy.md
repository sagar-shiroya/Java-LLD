# Strategy Design Pattern

It's behavioral design pattern.

It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm and make them interchangeable. It allows client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime without changing the code.

Imagine if you're having shopping cart, and you want to provide different payment option to users. So before checkout users set the payment method and checkout with the total amount. And it should pay via respective payment methods.
