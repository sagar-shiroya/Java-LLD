# Adapter Design Pattern

Imagine you have a cool new toy that needs different types of batteries to work. But, uh-oh, you only have the wrong kind of batteries!

The adapter design pattern is like having a magical battery converter. It's a special device that lets you use your wrong batteries with the toy. So, instead of buying new batteries, you just plug them into the adapter, and it makes everything work perfectly!

In simpler words, the adapter pattern helps things that wouldn't normally work together to work smoothly by providing a middleman that translates between them. It's like having a language translator for toys and batteries!
